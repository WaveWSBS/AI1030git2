# Greetings from Zichen!

Hello! I'm excited to contribute to this project through collaborative Git workflows. This file demonstrates how pull requests enable teams to review code, discuss changes, and maintain high-quality codebases. Working together using version control is one of the most important skills in modern software development, and I'm glad to be learning these practices through hands-on experience.

Looking forward to seeing this merged into the main branch!
